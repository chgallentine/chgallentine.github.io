# Skills
- skill: Systems Design, Integration & Troubleshooting
  description: Design and diagnose complex electromechanical, fluidic, and robotic systems using first-principles analysis and rapid iteration. Comfortable taking unfamiliar systems apart, identifying root causes, and driving practical fixes from concept through validation.

- skill: Modeling, Prototyping & Testing
  description: Develop analytical and numerical models of discrete and continuum systems to guide design decisions. Design hardware using CAD/CAM workflows, additive and subtractive manufacturing, and hands-on experimental methods. Plan and execute experiments, analyze performance data, and iterate designs with reliability and repeatability in mind.

- skill: Controls, Computation & Embedded Systems
  description: Implement embedded and desktop software in MATLAB/Simulink, C/C++, and Python for modeling, sensing, actuation, and closed-loop control. Experience with linear and nonlinear control, hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing, and integration of sensors, motors, and controllers. 

- skill: Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering
  description: Design novel electromechanical, fluidic, and textile-based devices from blank-sheet concepts through characterization and documentation. Apply GD&T (ASME Y14.5), design for manufacturability, and optimization for CNC machining, conventional fabrication, and additive processes.

- skill: Communication, Teaching & Leadership
  description: Communicate technical ideas clearly through written documentation, publications, and presentations to both technical and non-technical audiences. Teach, mentor, and collaborate with teams spanning multiple disciplines and experience levels. Produce clear engineering drawings, test reports, and process documentation to support team execution.

- skill: "Tools & Languages:"
  description: MATLAB/Simulink, Python, C/C++, embedded C, FPGA, microcontrollers (MSP430), SolidWorks, Inventor, Fusion 360, Onshape, PCB design, test automation, hardware validation
