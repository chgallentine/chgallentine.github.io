			<p class="color-1">Hi, I'm Charlie Gallentine, a sophomore at Clemson University. I am currently majoring in computer engineering with minors in math and computer science. I enjoy programming and primarily have been practicing web development. I would love to learn more about system programming and robotics, and I feel that my major is pointing me in the right direction.</p>
			<p class="color-1">It is my hope that this website will serve both as an extension of my resume, and a way for me to demonstrate what I have learned and practiced. I will update it frequently with my attempts at making features, and different projects.</p>
			<p class="color-1">A little more about me, in what can tenuously be called my free time, I love woodworking, rock climbing, and running. There are very few foods which I don't enjoy, however, my favorite is gnocchi. I have had classroom instruction in C and C++ along with extracuricular experience with Python and Java. I initially started to learn coding in Javascript via FreeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy.</p>
			<p class="color-1">Feel free to reach out if there is information you would like to know about me or if you want to give me a job!<br/><br/>- Charlie</p>
